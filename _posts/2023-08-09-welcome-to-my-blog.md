This is my first post in my resurrected blog. I'll talk about coding, hacking, reverse engineering, and 
whatever else I can think of to write about. I had one on Wordpress a few years ago where I would put 
writeups of cracking challenges, but I stopped blogging when I started writing books. Hence, resurrection.
I like GitHub better so I'll migrate my best writeups to pages. Or maybe I won't, who knows.

Anyways, I figure I should give some background info about myself so here's a list of the books that I've written:
* Murach's Python for Data Analysis - 
  https://www.murach.com/shop-books/python-programming-books/murach-s-python-for-data-analysis-detail
* Murach's R for Data Analysis - 
  https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-r-for-data-analysis-detail

I've been fortunate enough to contribute to most of Murach's other current titles too (as of August 2023).

Although I haven't done much academic writing, I did help with a poster or two during a brief
stint I did in a bioinformatics lab during my undergraduate. This was the only link that I could find regarding 
that work though: https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/events/837/sessions/5692/download

It's poster B70 for the record, though I doubt this will ever be read. I think there's a second one floating 
around somewhere but I haven't bothered to find it. The biologists did all the presenting for it anyways.

I'll add more stuff to this page later. Or maybe I won't, who knows...
